        Included Algorithms
        ===================
        
        String comparison:
        
        * Levenshtein Distance
        * Damerau-Levenshtein Distance
        * Jaro Distance
        * Jaro-Winkler Distance
        * Match Rating Approach Comparison
        * Hamming Distance
        
        Phonetic encoding:
        
        * American Soundex
        * Metaphone
        * NYSIIS (New York State Identification and Intelligence System)
        * Match Rating Codex
        
        Example Usage
        =============
        
        >>> import jellyfish
        >>> jellyfish.levenshtein_distance(u'jellyfish', u'smellyfish')
        2
        >>> jellyfish.jaro_distance(u'jellyfish', u'smellyfish')
        0.89629629629629637
        >>> jellyfish.damerau_levenshtein_distance(u'jellyfish', u'jellyfihs')
        1
        
        >>> jellyfish.metaphone(u'Jellyfish')
        'JLFX'
        >>> jellyfish.soundex(u'Jellyfish')
        'J412'
        >>> jellyfish.nysiis(u'Jellyfish')
        'JALYF'
        >>> jellyfish.match_rating_codex(u'Jellyfish')
        'JLLFSH'
        
        Running Tests
        =============
        
        If you are interested in contributing to Jellyfish, you may want to
        run tests locally. Jellyfish uses tox_ to run tests, which you can
        setup and run as follows::
        
          pip install tox
          # cd jellyfish/
          tox
